# Pair Deep View Client Samples
**Provide an engaging augmented-reality retail experience that can increase sales and reduce returns.** This repo contains sample HTML pages that show how you can integrate Pair Deep View onto your site.

# Getting Started

Host the repo's root directory with any local webserver and load up index.html. (Unfortunately, due to how resources are loaded you won't be able to view the samples loaded as file://) This will let you browse and view the available samples as well as find the JS API documentation.

# Integrating the Full Flow on Your Site

Examine the "visualizer-demo-from-server.html" file to see an example of the full user-experience flow. Before testing you'll need to reach out to us to request an API key. Once you have the API key, enter into the text box, and proceed with the user flow. A more robust sample will be put up soon.
